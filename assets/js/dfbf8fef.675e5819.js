So, when the new monetary order was set out in the Bretton Woods agreement, it continued to base money on gold, the dollar was linked to gold (other countries could use the dollars they acquired to buy gold at $35 an ounce), and other countries\u2019 currencies were linked to gold. Then, between 1944 and 1971, the US government spent a lot more than it took in from taxes, so it borrowed a lot, which it sold as debt, thus creating a lot more claims on gold than there was gold in the central bank. Seeing this, other countries started turning their paper money in for gold. This made money and credit undesirably tight, so President Nixon did the same thing in 1971 as President Roosevelt did in 1933, again devaluing fiat money relative to gold, and the price of gold soared. Suffice it to say that from then until now, a) government debt and debt service costs rose sharply relative to the tax income needed to service the government debt (especially in the 2008-12 period following the 2008 global financial crisis and since 2020, when there was the COVID financial crisis); b) income and values gaps grew to where they are now, which is very large, so we now have irreconcilable political differences; and c) the stock market is probably in a bubble boosted by the credit-, debt-, and creativity-supported speculations on new technologies."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\u4e0d\u6df1\u7a76\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6307\u51fa\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8ba9\u7f8e\u56fd\u6781\u5bcc\uff08\u6301\u5168\u7403\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u9ec4\u91d1\u8d27\u5e01\uff09\u4e14\u5f3a\uff08\u5360\u5168\u7403 GDP \u4e00\u534a\u3001\u519b\u4e8b\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff09\u3002\u5e03\u96f7\u987f\u68ee\u6797\u534f\u8bae\u786e\u7acb\u65b0\u8d27\u5e01\u79e9\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ecd\u4ee5\u9ec4\u91d1\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7f8e\u5143\u6302\u94a9\u9ec4\u91d1\uff08\u4ed6\u56fd\u53ef\u6309 35 \u7f8e\u5143 / \u76ce\u53f8\u5151\u91d1\uff09\uff0c\u4ed6\u56fd\u8d27\u5e01\u95f4\u63a5\u6302\u94a9\u9ec4\u91d1\u30021944-1971 \u5e74\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u652f\u51fa\u8d85\u7a0e\u6536\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u4e3e\u503a\uff0c\u9ec4\u91d1\u5151\u4ed8\u9700\u6c42\u8d85\u50a8\u5907\uff0c\u4ed6\u56fd\u7eb7\u7eb7\u5151\u91d1\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u4fe1\u8d37\u6536\u7d27\uff0c\u5c3c\u514b\u677e 1971 \u5e74\u6548\u4eff\u7f57\u65af\u798f\u8ba9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u8d27\u5e01\u5151\u91d1\u8d2c\u503c\uff0c\u9ec4\u91d1\u66b4\u6da8\u3002\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b64\u540e\u81f3\u4eca\uff1aa\uff09\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u52a1\u53ca\u507f\u503a\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a0e\u6536\u5927\u5e45\u4e0a\u5347\uff08\u5c24\u5176 2008 \u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u540e 2008-2012 \u5e74\u30012020 \u5e74\u65b0\u51a0\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u540e\uff09\uff1bb\uff09\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u8d22\u5bcc\u5dee\u8ddd\u6269\u81f3\u5f53\u524d\u6781\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6b67\u96be\u8c03\u548c\uff1bc\uff09\u4fe1\u8d37\u3001\u503a\u52a1\u53ca\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6295\u673a\u63a8\u9ad8\u80a1\u5e02\uff0c\u6216\u5904\u6ce1\u6cab\u3002"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\u4e0b\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u6536\u5165\u524d 10% \u4e0e\u540e 90% \u7fa4\u4f53\u5360\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5dee\u8ddd\u6781\u5927\u3002"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"Image",src:n(48618).A+"",width:"679",height:"297"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Where We Are Now \u6211\u4eec\u5f53\u524d\u6240\u5904\u5883\u5730"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The United States and all the other countries\u2019 governments that have overborrowed and are democratically run are now in a position where they a) can\u2019t increase their debts as they did before, b) can\u2019t raise taxes enough, and c) can\u2019t cut spending enough to prevent running deficits and increasing their debts.

Of course, wealth taxes wouldn\u2019t be levied on all people; they would be levied on the rich. I won\u2019t get into the numbers now, as this piece has gone on long enough. Suffice it to say that wealth taxes would 1) trigger a forced selling of private and public equity, depressing valuations; 2) increase credit demand, potentially inflating borrowing costs for the wealthy and for markets generally; and 3) encourage offshoring or relocation of wealth to friendlier jurisdictions. These pressures become acute if governments impose wealth taxes on unrealized gains or illiquid assets such as private equity, venture holdings, or even concentrated public equity positions."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\u6b64\u7c7b\u7a0e\u6536\u5fc5\u523a\u7834\u6ce1\u6cab\u3001\u5f15\u53d1\u5d29\u76d8\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8d22\u5bcc\u7a0e\u4e0d\u9488\u5bf9\u5168\u6c11\uff0c\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5bcc\u4eba\u3002\u4e0d\u6df1\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u6587\u7ae0\u5df2\u8fc7\u957f\u3002\u9700\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u8d22\u5bcc\u7a0e\u5c06\uff1a1\uff09\u89e6\u53d1\u516c\u79c1\u80a1\u5f3a\u5236\u629b\u552e\uff0c\u538b\u4f4e\u4f30\u503c\uff1b2\uff09\u589e\u4fe1\u8d37\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6216\u63a8\u9ad8\u5bcc\u4eba\u53ca\u5e02\u573a\u501f\u8d37\u6210\u672c\uff1b3\uff09\u4fc3\u4f7f\u8d22\u5bcc\u5411\u7a0e\u6536\u53cb\u597d\u5730\u533a\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u82e5\u5bf9\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6536\u76ca\u6216\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u7b49\u975e\u6d41\u52a8\u8d44\u4ea7\u5f81\u7a0e\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u5c06\u5267\u589e\u3002"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.em,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"END"})})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Jevons\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7b14\u8bb0"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a,{children:(0,i.jsx)("link",{rel:"canonical",href:"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/J7OfMmj7mDgjx_uuDof7WQ"})})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>h});var a=n(96540);const i={},o=a.createContext(i);function s(e){const t=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function h(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},47112:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/571a65149ed5b4909d77ec1d068952de_MD5-1e5940320328e4b4232a02688c0fda07.webp"},47183:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/ab827070a2b55f646fb5bef3785de994_MD5-90701aca274928501817c595d72573cd.webp"},48618:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/3b7bff2b5cd559a58afa2a1c3b46abfe_MD5-f350046ffab8cbb6c24dc2bf5231f384.webp"},89900:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/884911efd71c587eba0f4d4a8e9ec333_MD5-a4373c7c8218c73ee66b53564d95b8a3.webp"},96521:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/88e3d71b92b897c98a2c28accb00c4b1_MD5-94b4d500259942f8d21727a0f75abaf2.webp"}}]);
