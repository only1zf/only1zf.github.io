Similarly, having to wait for a code review can delay a developer's ability to continue working. Batching up code reviews so they don't interrupt a developer's coding time (which would impact individual measures), while also not causing delays in the throughput of the system (which impacts system measures), allows teams to deliver code efficiently (team-level measures). Therefore, measuring the effects of code-review timing on the efficiency and flow of individuals, teams, and the system is important\u2014this can be done through perceptual or telemetry measures that capture the time to complete reviews and the characteristics of interruptions (such as timing and frequency)."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Let's examine the SPACE framework in more depth by looking further at the dimensions of (1) activity and (2) efficiency and flow.

And if leaders measured progress using story points without asking developers about their ability to work quickly, they wouldn't be able to identify if something wasn't working and the team was doing workarounds and burning out, or if a new innovation was working particularly well and could be used to help other teams that may be struggling."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"This leads to an important point about metrics and their effect on teams and organizations: They signal what is important.
