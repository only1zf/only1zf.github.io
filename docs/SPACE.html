<p>Developer productivity is complex and nuanced, with important implications for software development teams. A clear understanding of defining, measuring, and predicting developer productivity could provide organizations, managers, and developers with the ability to make higher-quality software—and make it more efficiently.</p>
<p>Developer productivity has been studied extensively. Unfortunately, after decades of research and practical development experience, knowing how to measure productivity or even define developer productivity has remained elusive, while myths about the topic are common. Far too often teams or managers attempt to measure developer productivity with simple metrics, attempting to capture it all with &quot;one metric that matters.&quot;</p>
<p>One important measure of productivity is personal perception;<sup>1</sup> this may resonate with those who claim to be in &quot;a flow&quot; on productive days.</p>
<p>There is also agreement that developer productivity is necessary not just to improve engineering outcomes, but also to ensure the well-being and satisfaction of developers, as productivity and satisfaction are intricately connected.<sup>12</sup><sup>,20</sup></p>
<p>Ensuring the efficient development of software systems and the well-being of developers has never been more important as the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the majority of software developers worldwide to work from home, <sup> 17</sup> disconnecting developers and managers from their usual workplaces and teams. Although this was unexpected and unfortunate, this change constitutes a rare &quot;natural experiment&quot; that statisticians can capitalize upon to study, compare, and understand developer productivity across many different contexts. This forced disruption and the future transition to hybrid remote/colocated work expedites the need to understand developer productivity and well-being, with wide agreement that doing so in an efficient and fair way is critical.</p>
<p>This article explicates several common myths and misconceptions about developer productivity. <strong>The most important takeaway from exposing these myths is that productivity cannot be reduced to a single dimension (or metric!).</strong> The prevalence of these myths and the need to bust them motivated our work to develop a practical multidimensional framework, because only by examining a constellation of metrics in tension can we understand and influence developer productivity. This framework, called SPACE, captures the most important dimensions of developer productivity: satisfaction and well-being; performance; activity; communication and collaboration; and efficiency and flow. By recognizing and measuring productivity with more than just a single dimension, teams and organizations can better understand how people and teams work, and they can make better decisions.</p>
<p>The article demonstrates how this framework can be used to understand productivity in practice and why using it will help teams better understand developer productivity, create better measures to inform their work and teams, and may positively impact engineering outcomes and developer well-being.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="myths-and-misconceptions-about-developer-productivity">Myths and Misconceptions about Developer Productivity<a href="#myths-and-misconceptions-about-developer-productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Myths and Misconceptions about Developer Productivity的直接链接" title="Myths and Misconceptions about Developer Productivity的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>A number of myths about developer productivity have accumulated over the years. Awareness of these misconceptions leads to a better understanding of measuring productivity.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="myth-productivity-is-all-about-developer-activity">Myth: Productivity is all about developer activity<a href="#myth-productivity-is-all-about-developer-activity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Myth: Productivity is all about developer activity的直接链接" title="Myth: Productivity is all about developer activity的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>This is one of the most common myths, and it can cause undesirable outcomes and developer dissatisfaction. Sometimes, higher volumes of activity appear for various reasons: working longer hours may signal developers having to &quot;brute-force&quot; work to overcome bad systems or poor planning to meet a predefined release schedule. On the other hand, increased activity may reflect better engineering systems, providing developers with the tools they need to do their jobs effectively, or better collaboration and communication with team members in unblocking their changes and code reviews.</p>
<p>Activity metrics alone do not reveal which of these is the case, so they should never be used in isolation either to reward or to penalize developers. Even straightforward metrics such as number of pull requests, commits, or code reviews are prone to errors because of gaps in data and measurement errors, and systems that report these metrics will miss the benefits of collaboration seen in peer programming or brainstorming. Finally, developers often flex their hours to meet deadlines, making certain activity measures difficult to rely on in assessing productivity.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="myth-productivity-is-only-about-individual-performance">Myth: Productivity is only about individual performance<a href="#myth-productivity-is-only-about-individual-performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Myth: Productivity is only about individual performance的直接链接" title="Myth: Productivity is only about individual performance的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>While individual performance is important, contributing to the success of the team is also critical to measuring productivity. Measures of performance that balance the developer, team, and organization are important. Similar to team sports, success is judged both by a player&#x27;s personal performance as well as the success of their team. A developer who optimizes only for their own personal productivity may hurt the productivity of the team. More team-focused activities such as code reviews, on-call rotations, and developing and managing engineering systems help maintain the quality of the code base and the product/service. Finding the right balance in optimizing for individual, team, and organizational productivity, as well as understanding possible tradeoffs, is key.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="myth-one-productivity-metric-can-tell-us-everything">Myth: One productivity metric can tell us everything<a href="#myth-one-productivity-metric-can-tell-us-everything" class="hash-link" aria-label="Myth: One productivity metric can tell us everything的直接链接" title="Myth: One productivity metric can tell us everything的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>One common myth about developer productivity is that it produces a universal metric, and that this &quot;one metric that matters&quot; can be used to score teams on their overall work and to compare teams across an organization and even an industry. This isn&#x27;t true. Productivity represents several important dimensions of work and is greatly influenced by the context in which the work is done.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="myth-productivity-measures-are-useful-only-for-managers">Myth: Productivity Measures ARE useful only for managers<a href="#myth-productivity-measures-are-useful-only-for-managers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Myth: Productivity Measures ARE useful only for managers的直接链接" title="Myth: Productivity Measures ARE useful only for managers的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Developers often say that productivity measures aren&#x27;t useful. This may come from the misuse of measures by leaders or managers, and it&#x27;s true that when productivity is poorly measured and implemented, it can lead to inappropriate usage in organizations. It&#x27;s disappointing that productivity has been co-opted this way, but it&#x27;s important to note that developers have found value in tracking their own productivity—both for personal reasons and for communicating with others.</p>
<p>By remembering that developer productivity is personal,<sup>7</sup> developers can leverage it to gain insights into their work so they can take control of their time, energy, and days. For example, research has shown that high productivity is highly correlated with feeling satisfied and happy with work.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup><sup>,20</sup> Finding ways to improve productivity is also about finding ways to introduce more joy, and decrease frustration, in a developer&#x27;s day.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="myth-productivity-is-only-about-engineering-systems-and-developer-tools">Myth: Productivity is only about engineering systems and developer tools<a href="#myth-productivity-is-only-about-engineering-systems-and-developer-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Myth: Productivity is only about engineering systems and developer tools的直接链接" title="Myth: Productivity is only about engineering systems and developer tools的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>While developer tools and workflows have a large impact on developer productivity, human factors such as environment and work culture have substantial impact too. Often the critical work needed to keep the environment and culture healthy can be &quot;invisible&quot; to many members of the organization or to metrics traditionally used for measuring productivity. Work such as morale building, mentoring, and knowledge sharing are all critical to supporting a productive work environment and yet are often not measured. The &quot;invisible&quot; work that benefits the overall productivity of the team is just as important as other more commonly-measured dimensions.<sup>21</sup></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="space-a-framework-for-understanding-developer-productivity">SPACE: A Framework for Understanding Developer Productivity<a href="#space-a-framework-for-understanding-developer-productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="SPACE: A Framework for Understanding Developer Productivity的直接链接" title="SPACE: A Framework for Understanding Developer Productivity的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Productivity is about more than the individual or the engineering systems; it cannot be measured by a single metric or activity data alone; and it isn&#x27;t something that only managers care about. The SPACE framework was developed to capture different dimensions of productivity because without it, the myths just presented will persist. The framework provides a way to think rationally about productivity in a much bigger space and to choose metrics carefully in a way that reveals not only what those metrics mean, but also what their limitations are if used alone or in the wrong context.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="satisfaction-and-well-being">Satisfaction and well-being<a href="#satisfaction-and-well-being" class="hash-link" aria-label="Satisfaction and well-being的直接链接" title="Satisfaction and well-being的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><em>Satisfaction</em> is how fulfilled developers feel with their work, team, tools, or culture; <em>well-being</em> is how healthy and happy they are, and how their work impacts it. Measuring satisfaction and well-being can be beneficial for understanding productivity <sup>20</sup> and perhaps even for predicting it.<sup>15</sup> For example, <strong>productivity and satisfaction are correlated</strong>, and it is possible that satisfaction could serve as a leading indicator for productivity; a decline in satisfaction and engagement could signal upcoming burnout and reduced productivity.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>For example, when many places shifted to mandatory work from home during the pandemic, an uptick occurred in some measures of productivity (e.g., code commits and speed to merge pull requests).<sup>8</sup> Qualitative data, however, has shown that some people were struggling with their well-being.<sup>3</sup> This highlights the importance of balanced measures that capture several aspects of productivity: While some activity measures looked positive, additional measures of satisfaction painted a more holistic picture, showing that productivity is personal, and some developers were approaching burnout. To combat this, some software groups in large organizations implemented &quot;mental health&quot; days—essentially, free days off to help people avoid burnout and improve well-being.</p>
<p>It is clear that satisfaction and well-being are important dimensions of productivity. These qualities are often best captured with surveys. To assess the satisfaction dimension, you might measure the following:</p>
<p>• Employee satisfaction. The degree of satisfaction among employees, and whether they would recommend their team to others.</p>
<p>• Developer efficacy. Whether developers have the tools and resources they need to get their work done.</p>
<p>• Burnout. Exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged workplace stress.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Performance的直接链接" title="Performance的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><em>Performance</em> is the outcome of a system or process. The performance of software developers is hard to quantify, because it can be difficult to tie individual contributions directly to product outcomes. A developer who produces a large amount of code may not be producing high-quality code. High-quality code may not deliver customer value. Features that delight customers may not always result in positive business outcomes. Even if a particular developer&#x27;s contribution can be tied to business outcomes, it is not always a reflection of performance since the developer may have been assigned a less impactful task, instead of having agency to choose more impactful work. Furthermore, software is often the sum of many developers&#x27; contributions, exacerbating the difficulty in evaluating the performance of any individual developer. In many companies and organizations, software is written by teams, not individuals.</p>
<p>For these reasons, **performance is often best evaluated as <em>outcomes</em> instead of *output.***The most simplified view of software developer performance could be, Did the code written by the developer reliably do what it was supposed to do? Example metrics to capture the performance dimension include:</p>
<p>• Quality. Reliability, absence of bugs, ongoing service health.</p>
<p>• Impact. Customer satisfaction, customer adoption and retention, feature usage, cost reduction.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="activity">Activity<a href="#activity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Activity的直接链接" title="Activity的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><em>Activity</em> is a count of actions or outputs completed in the course of performing work. Developer activity, if measured correctly, can provide valuable but limited insights about developer productivity, engineering systems, and team efficiency. Because of the complex and diverse activities that developers perform, their activity is not easy to measure or quantify. In fact, it is <strong>almost impossible to comprehensively measure and quantify all the facets of developer activity across engineering systems and environments</strong>. A well-designed engineering system, however, will help in capturing activity metrics along different phases of the software development life cycle and quantify developer activity at scale. Some of the developer activities that can be measured and quantified relatively easily are:</p>
<p>• Design and coding. Volume or count of design documents and specs, work items, pull requests, commits, and code reviews.</p>
<p>• Continuous integration and deployment. Count of build, test, deployment/release, and infrastructure utilization.</p>
<p>• Operational activity. Count or volume of incidents/issues and distribution based on their severities, on-call participation, and incident mitigation.</p>
<p>These metrics can be used as waypoints to measure some tractable developer activities, but they should never be used in isolation to make decisions about individual or team productivity because of their known limitations. They serve as templates to start with and should be customized based on organizational needs and development environments. As mentioned earlier, many activities that are essential to developing software are intractable (such as attending team meetings, participating in brainstorming, helping other team members when they encounter issues, and providing architectural guidance, to name a few).</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="communication-and-collaboration">Communication and collaboration<a href="#communication-and-collaboration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Communication and collaboration的直接链接" title="Communication and collaboration的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><em>Communication and collaboration</em> capture how people and teams communicate and work together. Software development is a collaborative and creative task that relies on extensive and effective communication, coordination, and collaboration within and between teams.<sup>11</sup> Effective teams that successfully contribute to and integrate each other&#x27;s work efficiently rely on high transparency <sup>5</sup> and awareness <sup>6</sup> of team member activities and task priorities. In addition, how information flows within and across teams impacts the availability and discoverability of documentation that is needed for the effective alignment and integration of work. Teams that are diverse and inclusive are higher performing.<sup>22</sup> More effective teams work on the right problems, are more likely to be successful at brainstorming new ideas, and will choose better solutions from all the alternatives.</p>
<p>Work that contributes to a team&#x27;s outcomes or supports another team member&#x27;s productivity may come at the expense of an individual&#x27;s productivity and their own ability to get into a state of flow, potentially reducing motivation and satisfaction. Effective collaboration, however, can drive down the need for some individual activities (e.g., unnecessary code reviews and rework), improve system performance (faster pull request merges may improve quality by avoiding bugs), and help sustain productivity and avoid (or conversely, if not done right, increase) burnout.</p>
<p>Understanding and measuring team productivity and team member expectations are, however, complicated because of items that are difficult to measure such as invisible work <sup>21</sup> and articulation work for coordinating and planning team tasks.<sup>18</sup> That said, the following are examples of metrics that may be used as proxies to measure communication, collaboration, and coordination:</p>
<p>• Discoverability of documentation and expertise.</p>
<p>• How quickly work is integrated.</p>
<p>• Quality of reviews of work contributed by team members.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>efficiency</em> and <em>flow</em> capture the ability to complete work or make progress on it with minimal interruptions or delays, whether individually or through a system. This can include how well activities within and across teams are orchestrated and whether continuous progress is being made.</p>
<p>Some research associates productivity with the ability to get complex tasks done with minimal distractions or interruptions.<sup>2</sup> <strong>This conceptualization of productivity is echoed by many developers when they talk about &quot;getting into the flow&quot; when doing their work</strong> —or the difficulty in finding and optimizing for it, with many books and discussions addressing how this positive state can be achieved in a controlled way.<sup>4</sup> For individual efficiency (flow), it&#x27;s important to set boundaries to get productive and stay productive—for example, by blocking off time for a focus period. Individual efficiency is often measured by uninterrupted focus time or the time within value-creating apps (e.g., the time a developer spends in the integrated development environment is likely to be considered &quot;productive&quot; time).</p>
<p>At the team and system level, efficiency is related to value-stream mapping, which captures the steps needed to take software from idea and creation to delivering it to the end customer. To optimize the flow in the value stream, it is important to minimize delays and handoffs. The DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) framework introduced several metrics to monitor flow within teams <sup>9</sup> —for example, deployment frequency measures how often an organization successfully releases to production, and lead time for changes measures the amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.</p>
<p>In addition to the flow of changes through the system, the flow of knowledge and information is important. Certain aspects of efficiency and flow may be hard to measure, but it is often possible to spot and remove inefficiencies in the value stream. Activities that produce no value for the customer or user are often referred to as software development waste <sup>19</sup> —for example, duplicated work, rework because the work was not done correctly, or time-consuming rote activities.</p>
<p>Some example metrics to capture the efficiency and flow dimension are:</p>
<p>• Number of handoffs in a process; number of handoffs across different teams in a process.</p>
<p>• Perceived ability to stay in flow and complete work.</p>
<p>• Interruptions: quantity, timing, how spaced, impact on development work and flow.</p>
<p>• Time measures through a system: total time, value-added time, wait time.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency is related to all the SPACE dimensions.</strong> Efficiency at the individual, team, and system levels has been found to be positively associated with increased satisfaction. Higher efficiency, however, may also negatively affect other factors. For example, maximizing flow and speed may decrease the quality of the system and increase the number of bugs visible to customers (performance). Optimizing for individual efficiency by reducing interruptions may decrease the ability to collaborate, block others&#x27; work, and reduce the ability of the team to brainstorm.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="framework-in-action">Framework in Action<a href="#framework-in-action" class="hash-link" aria-label="Framework in Action的直接链接" title="Framework in Action的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>To illustrate the SPACE framework, figure 1 lists concrete metrics that fall into each of the five dimensions. The figure provides examples of individual-, team- or group-, and system-level measures. Three brief discussions about these metrics follow: First, an example set of metrics concerning code review is shown to cover all dimensions of the SPACE framework, depending on how they are defined and proxied. Next, additional examples are provided for two select dimensions of the framework: activity, and efficiency and flow. The section closes with a discussion of how to use the framework: combining metrics for a holistic understanding of developer productivity, as well as cautions. The accompanying sidebar shows how the framework can be used for understanding productivity in incident management.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s begin with code review as an example scenario that presents a set of metrics that can cover all five dimensions of the SPACE framework, depending on how it is framed and which metric is used:</p>
<p>• Satisfaction. Perceptual measures about code reviews can reveal whether developers view the work in a good or bad light—for example if they present learning, mentorship, or opportunities to shape the codebase. This is important, because the number of code reviews per developer may signal dissatisfaction if some developers feel they are consistently assigned a disproportionate amount of code reviews, leaving them with less time for other work.</p>
<p>• Performance. Code-review velocity captures the speed of reviews; because this can reflect both how quickly an individual completes a review and the constraints of the team, it is both an individual- and a team-level metric. (For example, an individual could complete a review within an hour of being assigned, but a team could have a policy of leaving all reviews open for 24 hours to allow all team members to see the proposed changes.)</p>
<p>• Activity. Number of code reviews completed is an individual metric capturing how many reviews have been completed in a given time frame, and contributes to the final product.</p>
<p>• Communication and collaboration. Code reviews themselves are a way that developers collaborate through code, and a measure or score of the quality or thoughtfulness of code reviews is a great qualitative measure of collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>• Efficiency and flow. Code review is important but can cause challenges if it interrupts workflow or if delays cause constraints in the system. Similarly, having to wait for a code review can delay a developer&#x27;s ability to continue working. Batching up code reviews so they don&#x27;t interrupt a developer&#x27;s coding time (which would impact individual measures), while also not causing delays in the throughput of the system (which impacts system measures), allows teams to deliver code efficiently (team-level measures). Therefore, measuring the effects of code-review timing on the efficiency and flow of individuals, teams, and the system is important—this can be done through perceptual or telemetry measures that capture the time to complete reviews and the characteristics of interruptions (such as timing and frequency).</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s examine the SPACE framework in more depth by looking further at the dimensions of (1) activity and (2) efficiency and flow. In this example, the activity measures are individual-level metrics: number of commits, coding time (total time spent or times of day), and number of code reviews completed. These best describe work that directly contributes to the final product, understanding that work patterns and behaviors are influenced by the teams and environments in which developers work.</p>
<p>Efficiency and flow have a broader mix of metrics. Self-reported measures of productivity are best captured at the individual level: asking a developer whether the team is productive is subject to blind spots, while asking if that member felt productive or was able to complete work with minimal distractions is a useful signal. You can also measure the flow of work—whether code, documents, or other items—through a system, and capture metrics such as the time it takes or the number of handoffs, delays, and errors in the software delivery pipeline. These would constitute system-level metrics, because their values would capture the journey of the work item through the entire workflow, or system.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-to-use-the-framework">How to Use the Framework<a href="#how-to-use-the-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="How to Use the Framework的直接链接" title="How to Use the Framework的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>To measure developer productivity, teams and leaders (and even individuals) should capture several metrics across multiple dimensions of the framework—at least three are recommended. For example, if you&#x27;re already measuring commits (an activity measure), don&#x27;t simply add the number of pull requests and coding time to your metrics dashboard, as these are both activity metrics. Adding these can help round out the way you capture the activity dimension of productivity, but to really understand productivity, add at least one metric from two different dimensions: perhaps perception of productivity and pull request merge time.</p>
<p>Another recommendation is that at least one of the metrics include perceptual measures such as survey data. By including perceptions about people&#x27;s lived experiences, a more complete picture of productivity can be constructed. Many times, perceptual data may provide more accurate and complete information than what can be observed from instrumenting system behavior alone.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Including metrics from multiple dimensions and types of measurements often creates metrics in tension; this is by design, because a balanced view provides a truer picture of what is happening in your work and systems. This more balanced view should help to reinforce smarter decisions and tradeoffs among team members, who may otherwise understandably focus on one aspect of work to the detriment of the whole system.</p>
<p>One example is story points, a metric commonly used in Agile development processes to assess team-level progress. If a team is rated only on story points, members will focus on optimizing their own points, to the detriment of completing potentially invisible work that is important to other developers&#x27; progress and to the company if that means collaborating with other teams or onboarding future developers. And if leaders measured progress using story points without asking developers about their ability to work quickly, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to identify if something wasn&#x27;t working and the team was doing workarounds and burning out, or if a new innovation was working particularly well and could be used to help other teams that may be struggling.</p>
<p>This leads to an important point about metrics and their effect on teams and organizations: They signal what is important. One way to see indirectly what is important in an organization is to see what is measured, because that often communicates what is valued and influences the way people behave and react. For example, companies that care about employee health, well-being, and retention will likely include the satisfaction and well-being dimension in their productivity measures. As a corollary, adding to or removing metrics can nudge behavior, because that also communicates what is important.</p>
<p>For example, a team where &quot;productivity = lines of code&quot; alone is very different from a team where &quot;productivity = lines of code AND code review quality AND customer satisfaction.&quot; In this case, you have kept a (problematic, but probably embedded) metric about productivity and output, but nudged perceptions about productivity in a direction that also values both teamwork (by valuing thoughtful code reviews) and the end user (by valuing customer satisfaction).</p>
<p>Metrics shape behavior, so by adding and valuing just two metrics, you&#x27;ve helped shape a change in your team and organization. This is why it&#x27;s so important to be sure to pull from multiple dimensions of the framework: it will lead to much better outcomes at both the team and system levels. In this example, as the teams continue to improve and iterate, they could exchange the activity metric <em>lines of code</em> for something like <em>number of commits</em>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-to-watch-for">What to Watch For<a href="#what-to-watch-for" class="hash-link" aria-label="What to Watch For的直接链接" title="What to Watch For的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Having too many metrics may also lead to confusion and lower motivation; not all dimensions need to be included for the framework to be helpful. For example, if developers and teams are presented with an extensive list of metrics and improvement targets, meeting them may feel like an unattainable goal. With this in mind, note that a good measure of productivity consists of a handful of metrics across at least three dimensions; these can prompt a holistic view, and they can be sufficient to evoke improvement.</p>
<p>Any measurement paradigm should be used carefully because no metric can ever be a perfect proxy. Some metrics are poor measures because they are noisy approximations (some examples are noted in figure 1). Retention is often used to measure employee satisfaction; however, this can capture much more than satisfaction—it can reflect compensation, promotion opportunities, issues with a team, or even a partner&#x27;s move. At the team level, some managers may block transfers to protect their own retention ratings. Even if retention did reflect satisfaction, it is a lagging measure, and teams don&#x27;t see shifts until it is too late to do anything about it. We have written elsewhere about the limitations inherent in the use of story points,<sup>9</sup> which could give teams incentive to focus on their own work at the expense of collaborating on important projects.</p>
<p>Teams and organizations should be cognizant of developer privacy and report only anonymized, aggregate results at the team or group level. (In some countries, reporting on individual productivity isn&#x27;t legal.) Individual-level productivity analysis, however, may be insightful for developers. For example, previous research shows that typical developer work shifts depend on the phase of development, and developers may have more productive times of day.<sup>14</sup> Developers can opt in to these types of analyses, gaining valuable insights to optimize their days and manage their energy.</p>
<p>Finally, any measurement paradigm should check for biases and norms. These are external influences that may shift or influence the measures. Some examples are included here, but they aren&#x27;t exhaustive, so all teams are encouraged to look for and think about external influences that may be present in their data:</p>
<p>• Peer review and gender. Research shows that women are more likely to receive negative comments and less likely to receive positive comments in their code reviews.<sup>16</sup> Any analysis of satisfaction with the review process should check for this in your environment. Understand that developers are likely influenced by the broader tech industry even if the patterns are not in your organization or team. Take these effects into account.</p>
<p>• Normalizing measures across time. Teams should be careful about any methods used to normalize time, especially across long periods. For example, looking at metrics over a year would bias against those taking parental leave.</p>
<p>• Perceptual measures. Teams and organizations should be mindful of cultural norms—and embrace these. Some cultures naturally report higher, while some report lower. It doesn&#x27;t mean perceptual measures can&#x27;t be trusted; it just means measures from these different cultures will have a different baseline and shouldn&#x27;t be compared with each other.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="space-and-sre-the-framework-in-incident-management">SPACE and SRE: The Framework in Incident Management<a href="#space-and-sre-the-framework-in-incident-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="SPACE and SRE: The Framework in Incident Management的直接链接" title="SPACE and SRE: The Framework in Incident Management的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The SPACE framework is relevant for SREs (site reliability engineers) and their work in IM (incident management). An incident occurs when a service is not available or is not performing as defined in the SLA (service-level agreement). An incident can be caused by network issues, infrastructure problems, hardware failures, code bugs, or configuration issues, to name a few.</p>
<p>Based on the magnitude of the impact caused by an incident, it is typically assigned a severity level (sev-1 being the highest). An outage to the entire organization&#x27;s customer-facing systems is treated differently than a small subset of internal users experiencing a delay in their email delivery.</p>
<p>Here are some of the common myths associated with IM:</p>
<p>• MYTH: Number of incidents resolved by an individual is all that matters. Like a lot of other activities in the SDLC (software development life cycle), IM is a team activity. A service that causes a lot of outages and takes more hours to restore reflects badly on the entire team that develops and maintains the service. More team-focused activities such as knowledge sharing, preparing troubleshooting guides to aid other team members, mentoring juniors and new members of the team, doing proper handoffs and assignment/re-assignments are important aspects of IM.</p>
<p>• MYTH: Looking at one metric in isolation will tell you everything. It&#x27;s important to understand the metrics in context: the number of incidents, how long they took to resolve— the volume and resolution times of sev-1 incidents compared with sev-4, and other factors relevant to understanding incidents and how to improve both the system and the team&#x27;s response. So, there is no &quot;one metric that matters.&quot;</p>
<p>• MYTH: Only management cares about incident volume and meeting SLAs. With the rise of DevOps, developers are also doing operations now. IM (a part of operations) can take away a significant chunk of developers&#x27; time and energy if the volume and severity of the incidents are high. As important as it is to management and executives to guarantee SLAs and reduce incident volume and resolution times, it is equally important to the individual developers who are part of the IM process.</p>
<p>• MYTH: Effective IM is just about improving systems and tools. Better monitoring systems, ticketing systems, case-routing systems, log-analysis systems, etc. will help make developers productive. While tools, guides, and workflows have a large impact on productivity, the human factors of the environment and work culture have substantial impact too. Mentoring new members of the team and morale building are important. If developers are constantly being paged in the night for sev-1 incidents while working from home during Covid-19, these &quot;invisible&quot; factors are especially helpful to make them more productive.</p>
<p>Incident management is a complex process that involves various stakeholders performing several individual and team activities, and it requires support from different tools and systems, so it is critical to identify metrics that can capture various dimensions of productivity:</p>
<p><strong>• S</strong> atisfaction: how satisfied SREs are with the IM process, escalation and routing, and on-call rotations are key metrics to capture, especially since burnout is a significant issue among SREs.</p>
<p><strong>• P</strong> erformance: these measures focus on system reliability; monitoring systems&#x27; ability to detect and flag issues faster, before they hit the customer and become an incident. MTTR (mean time to repair) overall, and by severity.</p>
<p><strong>• A</strong> ctivity: number of issues caught by the monitoring systems, number of incidents created, number of incidents resolved—and their severity distribution.</p>
<p><strong>• C</strong> ommunication and collaboration: people included in resolving the incident, how many teams those people came from, and how they communicate during an incident. Incident resolution documentation outlines the steps involved in resolving incidents; this can be measured by completeness (to check if any resolution data was entered) or quick quality scores (e.g., thumbs up/down). Teams may also include a metric that measures the percentage of incidents resolved that reference these guides and documentation.</p>
<p><strong>• E</strong> fficiency and flow: incident handoffs, incident assignment/re-assignment, number of hops an incident has to take before it is assigned to the right individual or team.</p>

<p>Developer productivity is about more than an individual&#x27;s activity levels or the efficiency of the engineering systems relied on to ship software, and it cannot be measured by a single metric or dimension. We developed the SPACE framework to capture different dimensions of productivity, because without it, pervasive and potentially harmful myths about productivity may persist.</p>
<p>The SPACE framework provides a way to logically and systematically think about productivity in a much bigger space and to carefully choose balanced metrics linked to goals—and how they may be limited if used alone or in the wrong context. The framework helps illuminate tradeoffs that may not be immediately obvious and to account for invisible work and knock-on effects of changes such as increased work if activity is measured at the expense of unfulfilled developers or disruptions to overall flow and efficiency.</p>
<p>The need to understand and measure productivity holistically has never been greater. As the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted work and brought a sudden switch to working from home, many questioned its impact on productivity and posed questions around how to understand and measure this change. As the world slowly returns to a &quot;new normal,&quot; the SPACE framework captures the dimensions of productivity that are important to consider as future changes are proposed and made. The framework is meant to help individuals, teams, and organizations identify pertinent metrics that present a holistic picture of productivity; this will lead to more thoughtful discussions about productivity and to the design of more impactful solutions.</p>

<h1>开发者生产力的SPACE框架</h1>
<p><strong>原文作者：</strong> Nicole Forsgren, Margaret-Anne Storey, Chandra Maddila, Thomas Zimmermann, Brian Houck, and Jenna Butler</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="摘要">摘要<a href="#摘要" class="hash-link" aria-label="摘要的直接链接" title="摘要的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>开发者生产力是一个复杂的话题。当负责人和团队试图理解和衡量它时，常常会过度简化，导致只关注开发者活动的某些方面，而这些方面往往被误解或错误地应用。例如，将生产力等同于活动（如代码行数或提交次数）是有害的，并且往往会产生与预期相反的结果。为了帮助行业更好地思考和衡量生产力，我们提出了一个多维度的框架，可以帮助人们就生产力展开更清晰、更有意义的讨论。这个框架被称为SPACE，它涵盖了以下五个维度：</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>S (Satisfaction and well-being) - 满意度与身心健康</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>P (Performance) - 成效</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>A (Activity) - 活动</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>C (Communication and collaboration) - 沟通与协作</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>E (Efficiency and flow) - 效率与流畅度</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>本文将详细介绍这个框架，并讨论团队和组织如何应用它来全面地理解和提升开发者生产力。</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="引言">引言<a href="#引言" class="hash-link" aria-label="引言的直接链接" title="引言的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>“如何衡量开发者生产力？”这个问题一直困扰着软件行业的领导者和开发者。在当今世界，软件是业务成功的关键驱动力，这个问题的答案变得前所未有的重要。然而，关于如何衡量生产力的讨论常常充满争议和误解。</p>
<p>过去，人们常常使用一些简单的指标，如代码行数 (LOC)、提交次数或已关闭的工单数量。然而，这些指标充满了问题。它们无法捕捉到软件开发的全部图景，并且很容易被“游戏化”（即为了指标好看而做出无意义的行为），从而导致不良的团队文化和负面的业务成果。例如，一个开发者可能会为了增加代码行数而写出冗长、低效的代码。</p>
<p>开发者生产力远不止是写代码的速度。它还包括代码的质量、系统的可靠性、团队协作的顺畅度以及开发者自身的满意度和整体身心健康。一个感到倦怠、沮丧的开发者，即使活动指标很高，也无法长期保持高效。</p>
<p>为了解决这些挑战，我们综合了学术研究和行业实践，提出了SPACE框架。这个框架的目的不是提供一个单一的、通用的生产力指标，而是提供一个思考模型，帮助组织根据自身的目标和背景，选择一组平衡的、有意义的指标。</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="开发者生产力的五大误区">开发者生产力的五大误区<a href="#开发者生产力的五大误区" class="hash-link" aria-label="开发者生产力的五大误区的直接链接" title="开发者生产力的五大误区的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>在介绍SPACE框架之前，有必要先澄清一些关于开发者生产力的常见误区。</p>
<p><strong>误区一：生产力等同于开发者活跃度。</strong>
高活跃度（如大量的会议、代码提交或快速响应聊天消息）并不等同于高生产力。有时，高活跃度恰恰是系统性问题的表现——开发者可能因为流程不畅、文档缺失或需求不清而疲于奔命。</p>
<p><strong>误区二：生产力只是个人表现。</strong>
软件开发是一项团队运动。过分关注个人指标会损害团队的整体协作。像代码审查、指导新成员、编写文档等对团队至关重要的活动，可能不会体現在个人的“活动”指标中，但它们对整个团队的长期生产力至关重要。</p>
<p><strong>误区三：一个指标可以衡量一切。</strong>
没有任何一个单一指标能够捕捉到生产力的全貌。例如，部署频率（一个流行的DORA指标）是一个很好的团队级成效指标，但它并不能告诉你关于开发者满意度或代码质量的任何信息。生产力是多维度的，必须从多个角度来衡量。</p>
<p><strong>误区四：生产力指标只对管理者有用。</strong>
开发者自身也可以从理解和追踪生产力中受益。通过数据，开发者可以更好地了解自己的工作模式，识别瓶颈，并向管理者展示那些“看不见”的工作（如帮助他人、改进工具等）的价值，从而减少挫败感。</p>
<p><strong>误区五：生产力只与工程系统和开发工具相关。</strong>
虽然高效的工具和CI/CD流水线很重要，但生产力还受到许多其他因素的影响，例如组织文化、团队间的沟通、心理安全感以及知识共享的顺畅程度。</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="space框架详解">SPACE框架详解<a href="#space框架详解" class="hash-link" aria-label="SPACE框架详解的直接链接" title="SPACE框架详解的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>SPACE框架旨在提供一个全面的视角来审视开发者生产力。它由五个维度组成，任何对生产力的衡量都应该考虑这些不同维度的组合。</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="s---满意度与身心健康-satisfaction--well-being">S - 满意度与身心健康 (Satisfaction &amp; Well-being)<a href="#s---满意度与身心健康-satisfaction--well-being" class="hash-link" aria-label="S - 满意度与身心健康 (Satisfaction &amp; Well-being)的直接链接" title="S - 满意度与身心健康 (Satisfaction &amp; Well-being)的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>定义：</strong> 开发者对工作、团队、工具或文化的满意程度，以及他们的整体身心健康状况。
<strong>重要性：</strong> 满意的开发者更投入、更具创新性，并且离职率更低。满意度和身心健康状况的下降，往往是生产力下降的先行指标。
<strong>可衡量的指标示例：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>满意度：</strong> 通过问卷调查开发者对工作的满意度、对所用工具的满意度。</li>
<li class=""><strong>身心健康：</strong> 开发者自我报告的倦怠感、工作与生活的平衡。</li>
<li class=""><strong>员工净推荐值 (eNPS)：</strong> 员工向朋友推荐自己公司的意愿。</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="p---成效-performance">P - 成效 (Performance)<a href="#p---成效-performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="P - 成效 (Performance)的直接链接" title="P - 成效 (Performance)的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>定义：</strong> 软件交付过程所产生的实际业务成果。
<strong>重要性：</strong> 成效是生产力的最终体现，它直接关联到业务价值和客户满意度。成效应被理解为“结果(outcome)”，而不是“产出(output)”。
<strong>可衡量的指标示例：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>质量：</strong> 变更失败率、生产环境中的缺陷数量、代码的可维护性。</li>
<li class=""><strong>可靠性：</strong> 服务的可用性 (Uptime)、从故障中恢复的时间 (MTTR)。</li>
<li class=""><strong>客户影响：</strong> 功能采纳率、客户满意度分数 (CSAT)、业务指标的达成情况。</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="a---活动-activity">A - 活动 (Activity)<a href="#a---活动-activity" class="hash-link" aria-label="A - 活动 (Activity)的直接链接" title="A - 活动 (Activity)的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>定义：</strong> 在开发过程中完成的动作或产出物的计数。
<strong>重要性：</strong> 活动指标可以提供关于开发过程的某些洞察，但它们最容易被误用，<strong>绝不能孤立地作为生产力的衡量标准</strong>。
<strong>可衡量的指标示例：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>代码量：</strong> 提交次数、拉取请求 (PR) 数量。</li>
<li class=""><strong>部署与构建：</strong> 部署次数、构建次数。</li>
<li class=""><strong>其他活动：</strong> 设计文档的数量、代码评审的数量、参与的会议数量。</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="c---沟通与协作-communication--collaboration">C - 沟通与协作 (Communication &amp; Collaboration)<a href="#c---沟通与协作-communication--collaboration" class="hash-link" aria-label="C - 沟通与协作 (Communication &amp; Collaboration)的直接链接" title="C - 沟通与协作 (Communication &amp; Collaboration)的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>定义：</strong> 人员、团队之间连接和协同工作的方式和质量。
<strong>重要性：</strong> 现代软件开发高度依赖协作。高效的沟通可以减少信息壁垒，加速知识共享，并提高团队凝聚力。
<strong>可衡量的指标示例：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>代码评审：</strong> PR从创建到被首次评论的时间、PR的讨论质量。</li>
<li class=""><strong>知识共享：</strong> 文档的质量和可发现性、新成员上手所需的时间。</li>
<li class=""><strong>网络：</strong> 通过分析谁在评审谁的代码，来了解团队内部和团队之间的协作模式，识别知识孤岛。</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="e---效率与流畅度-efficiency--flow">E - 效率与流畅度 (Efficiency &amp; Flow)<a href="#e---效率与流畅度-efficiency--flow" class="hash-link" aria-label="E - 效率与流畅度 (Efficiency &amp; Flow)的直接链接" title="E - 效率与流畅度 (Efficiency &amp; Flow)的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>定义：</strong> 以最少的中断和延迟来完成工作或在任务中取得进展的能力。
<strong>重要性：</strong> 工作流程的流畅意味着开发者可以进入“心流”（flow）状态，持续专注地工作。频繁的打断和漫长的等待会极大地消耗开发者的精力和时间。
<strong>可衡量的指标示例：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>周期/前置时间：</strong> 从代码提交到部署上线所需的时间 (Lead Time for Changes)、从开始一个任务到完成的总时间 (Cycle Time)。</li>
<li class=""><strong>工作流：</strong> 拉取请求 (PR) 从创建到合并的总时间。</li>
<li class=""><strong>中断：</strong> 开发者每天的专注时间有多长？被会议或突发任务打断的频率如何？</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="如何应用space框架">如何应用SPACE框架<a href="#如何应用space框架" class="hash-link" aria-label="如何应用SPACE框架的直接链接" title="如何应用SPACE框架的直接链接" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. 从目标开始，而非指标</strong>
首先要问：“我们希望改进什么？”。是想加快交付速度？提高软件质量？还是提升开发者留存率？你的目标将决定你应该关注哪些维度的哪些指标。</p>
<p><strong>2. 选择平衡的指标组合</strong>
为了获得全面的图景，你应该从<strong>至少三个维度</strong>中选择指标。这可以确保你不会因为优化一个方面而损害另一个方面。</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>示例1：</strong> 如果你的目标是“加速功能交付”，你可以选择：<!-- -->
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>E (效率与流畅度):</strong> 周期时间 (Cycle Time)。</li>
<li class=""><strong>P (成效):</strong> 变更失败率 (确保速度没有牺牲质量)。</li>
<li class=""><strong>S (满意度与身心健康):</strong> 开发者倦怠感调查 (确保团队没有被压垮)。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. 结合不同类型的数据</strong>
好的衡量体系应该结合来自不同来源的数据：</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>系统数据：</strong> 从Git、Jira、CI/CD工具中自动收集的客观数据。</li>
<li class=""><strong>感知数据：</strong> 通过问卷调查和访谈收集的开发者主观感受和反馈。感知数据至关重要，因为它能解释系统数据背后的“为什么”。</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. 持续迭代和改进</strong>
生产力衡量不是一次性的项目，而是一个持续的过程。定期回顾你的指标，与团队讨论观察到的趋势，并根据反馈共同制定改进计划。记住，衡量的目的是为了驱动积极的变革，而不是为了评判个人。</p>

<p>将开发者生产力简化为单一、易于衡量的指标是极具诱惑力的，但这是一种危险的过度简化。这样做会忽略软件开发工作的复杂性和协作性，并可能导致意想不到的负面后果。</p>
<p>SPACE框架提供了一个结构化的方法，帮助组织、团队和个人更全面、更健康地思考开发者生产力。通过从<strong>满意度与身心健康、成效、活动、沟通协作以及效率与流畅度</strong>这五个维度中选择一组平衡的指标，我们可以开启更有意义的对话，做出更明智的决策，并最终创造一个让开发者能够茁壮成长并交付卓越价值的环境。</p></div></article><nav class="docusaurus-mt-lg pagination-nav" aria-label="文件选项卡"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#theres-more-to-it-than-you-think" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">There&#39;s more to it than you think.</a><ul><li><a href="#nicole-forsgren-github-margaret-anne-storey-university-of-victoria-chandra-maddila-thomas-zimmermann-brian-houck-and-jenna-butler-microsoft-research" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Nicole Forsgren, GitHub Margaret-Anne Storey, University of Victoria Chandra Maddila, Thomas Zimmermann, Brian Houck, and Jenna Butler, Microsoft Research</a></li><li><a href="#myths-and-misconceptions-about-developer-productivity" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Myths and Misconceptions about Developer Productivity</a></li><li><a href="#space-a-framework-for-understanding-developer-productivity" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">SPACE: A Framework for Understanding Developer Productivity</a></li><li><a href="#framework-in-action" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Framework in Action</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-use-the-framework" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">How to Use the Framework</a></li><li><a href="#what-to-watch-for" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What to Watch For</a></li><li><a href="#space-and-sre-the-framework-in-incident-management" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">SPACE and SRE: The Framework in Incident Management</a></li><li><a href="#why-this-matters-now" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Why This Matters Now</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#摘要" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">摘要</a></li><li><a href="#引言" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">引言</a></li><li><a href="#开发者生产力的五大误区" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">开发者生产力的五大误区</a></li><li><a href="#space框架详解" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">SPACE框架详解</a></li><li><a href="#如何应用space框架" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">如何应用SPACE框架</a></li><li><a href="#结论" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">结论</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Fan's life, Inc.
